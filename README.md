<h2 align="center">Subtask 1: "Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?"</h2>

*Hi, my name's Alina. I've made up my mind to take part in the challenge because I'm professionally burnt out. Quite frankly, I've never liked my job. It may sound stupid, but it's been a dream since my childhood to work in IT. And now I'm happy to have an opportunity to make my dream come true.*
 
*I expect to get new knowledge, experience, friends and job. They are precious for me.*
 
*ALINA*
